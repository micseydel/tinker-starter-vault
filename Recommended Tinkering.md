# Pre-reqs

- Per [[README]],
	- `tinkerenv.bash` is being used to bring up the Scala server
	- `transcriber.py` is active (the Whisper model also takes a moment to load)
- Find+replace all
	- `YYYY-MM-DD`
	- with your date, using Cmd+Opt+F, e.g.
		- 2024-11-25
	- which you may be able to get with Cmd+P "current date"

# Procedure

- Create a new audio note for each bullet below, with `python rec_unlimited_play.py ~/Tinker\ Casting\ Starter\ Kit/Tinker\ Casting\ Starter\ Vault/attachments/mobile_audio_captures/`
	- (In [[README|Getting Started]], we used tinker_demo.py which integrates rec_unlimited_play.py (which we're using here) and transcribe_and_generate_markdown.py)
	- (rec_unlimited_play.py also allows multiple recordings without having to reload the Whisper model every time, which makes it much faster)
- "(speak)" then be patient, a 5s recording shouldn't take more than 30s to appear
	- The README discusses using the logs, which can help with debugging

# Experiments

> [!caution] Warning
> - When you see "not created yet. Click to create." ==Do not click== - a note will be created by the code, and Obsidian will update automatically

- "Peanut just peed in the back litter box"
	- ![[Transcribed mobile notes (YYYY-MM-DD)#All]]
		- Consider going into the transcription (ref) note looking at the **backlinks** - the pane on right right in Obsidian (which may need to be expanded)
	- ![[CatsTranscriptions notes (YYYY-MM-DD)#All]]
	- ![[Litter boxes (YYYY-MM-DD)]]
	- ![[Upcoming Notifications]]
- "I just sifted poop from the back litter box"
	- ![[Litter boxes (YYYY-MM-DD)]]
	- ![[Upcoming Notifications]]
	- ![[Litter boxes sifting (YYYY-MM-DD)]]
- "Remind me to sift the litter box"
	- ![[Reminders]]
	- ![[Notification Center]]
		- (tempted to click once the box appears? try it! what happened?)
- [[Example Now Note|Example "Now" Note]] (kind of like a dashboard)
